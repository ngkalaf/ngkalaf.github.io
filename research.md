<p align="justify"> My general area is American Politics, and my research interests lie at the intersection of American political institutions and representation, with work focusing on how institutional incentives affect legislative behavior.  </p>

<p align="justify"> While much of my research focuses on groups outside of the traditional power structure, I also examine legislative behavior more generally, focusing on the activities members of Congress and other elected officials employ to reap benefits for their constituents. The methodological approaches I employ are primarily quantitative; relying on large original datasets built around quantitative content analysis of legislative speech, writings, and recorded behavior.  </p>

<p align="justify"> A side research agenda also includes pedagogical work on student engagement and instructional design, combining my scholarly work with my interest in teaching innovations more broadly. </p>
